# Bachelor Thesis - Autonomous Robotics Platforms
The goal of this thesis was to provide learning tool for the University of Sk√∂vde to be able to teach robotics.  

## Tools 
- ROS (Robot Operative System). This framework is widely used for agile development of robotic platforms. You can check out more about ROS [here](https://www.ros.org/)
- Python. The robot was programmed using python given its widely flexibility and quick implementation
- Gazebo. Simulation platform already implemented with ROS. This tool was used in order to test the concepts before implementing them in real life.

## Development

## Conclusions

## GitHub repository
The project is subdivided into:
- [Autonomous Robotics Real](www.github.com/nestoregon/). Code for the real robot in a live environment.
- [Autonomous Robotics Simulation](www.github.com/nestoregon/). Code for the robot simulation and its environment in Gazebo.
