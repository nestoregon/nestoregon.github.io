# Data Analyst - Grok Learning
[Grok Learning](www.groklearning.com) is a company based in Sydney that has an online platform to teach young people to code.  
The company had a lot of data from their different activities and wanted to get insight in their customers behavior. My role was tp analyze it.


## Tools
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) is a data analysis platform with an user-friendly interface
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

## Development
There were two major tasks carried out:
- Selection of the IoT platform. There is a wide range of IoT platforms and devices, I did a thorough examination of the IoT market and decided, based on price, specifications and performance the most suitable one for the job.

- Developing the IoT code. This included the development of an algorithm for the robot that would provide information everyday. It would also control the deployment of the robot under water with a PID controller.

## Conclusions
I learned how to work with my supervisor in charge of sales while remaining independent doing the tasks. I learnt new skills such as SQL and Tableau and learn how to apply my previous skills such as ML and Python to the new demanded tasks. This has taught me that there is no peak in your skills, one must reflect on their current skills and learn how to adapt to the new conditions to find the best suitable solution to a current problem. That's what I value the most.
