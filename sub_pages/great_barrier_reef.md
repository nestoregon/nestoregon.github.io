# Mapping of the Great Barrier Reef
Project for the Computer Vision course at the University of Sydney  
The goal was to map the barrier reef given a set of images and data belonging to 2 stereo vision cameras.

## Tools
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation.
- [Stero Vision Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_stereo_vision). In order to perform the mapping of the surface the students were provided a sample of the images captured by the camera.
