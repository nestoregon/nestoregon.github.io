ðŸŽ¯ The main purpose of this problem is to use ************stacks************ in order to rearrange containers.

</aside>

You can see containers arranged in this way.

Check the following instruction:

```python
move **1** from **2** to **1**
```

Which means:

- Move `1` item
- From column `2`
- Into column `1`

![Untitled](Day%205%20Cranes%2037f94df264544636a796ec570e7756f1/Untitled%201.png)

You can only move one block at a time.

### Transforming the input

The input can be split into two:

- Mapping of the containers
- Instructions

```
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

You can store the containers into a list:

- `['N', 'Z']`
- `['M', 'C', 'D']`
- `['P']`

Instructions can be used by extracting the digits.
