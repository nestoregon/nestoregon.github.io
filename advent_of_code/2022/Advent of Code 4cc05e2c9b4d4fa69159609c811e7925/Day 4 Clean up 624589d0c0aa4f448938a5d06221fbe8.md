# Day 4: Clean up

Elves need to clean up ðŸ§¹. They divide tasks between sections, and each elf is given multiple sections.

<aside>
ðŸŽ¯ This exercise is about creating two lists and finding the similar numbers between them.

## Reading input

You need to read a line like `5-7,7-9` and generate two lists.

This can be done using a function called `range()` where you give two numbers and a list is generated. This will create 2 lists:

- `5,6,7`
- `7,8,9`

## Sets

Finding differences between lists can be tricky. The easiest way is to use sets.

Simply cast the list into a set. `set(list_name)`.

Sets can be used to:

- Calculate union: `5,6,7,8,9`
- Calculate intersection: `7`
- Subtractions:
    - Calculate Blue - Red: `5,6`
    - Calculate Red - Blue: `8,9`

```python
set_one = {5, 6, 7}
set_two = {7, 8, 9}

print('Set 1:', set_one)
print('Set 2:', set_two)
print('Union', set_one.union(set_two))
print('Intersection', set_one.intersection(set_two))
print('Only Set 1', set_one - set_two)
print('Only Set 2', set_two - set_one)
```

## Schematic

The problem can be broken down into reading the input to generate the sets, find the differences with `intersection` and for part `1` checking only a unique list, and for part `2` checking if there are any similarities.
