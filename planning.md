#Planning

The purpose of this website is to showcase my work as a robotics and software engineer. I want to provide outstanding work and its explanations.

## Work

- [ ] Hullbot
- [ ] Grok Learning
- [ ] Great Barrier Reef
- [ ] Bachelor Degree Thesis
- [ ] Card detection algorithm
- [ ] Python automation of Students



I would also like to find a way to explain all this in an orderly manner. For example it might be interesting to plan it in sections:
- Robotics Engineering
- Side projects
- Data analysis


By doing so the person that is reviewing my website can easily identify what he is looking for. Otherwise I can have the "starred" projects which I think are the most interesting and then links to less interesting projects (divided by categories).
